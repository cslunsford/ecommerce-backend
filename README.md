# Ecommerce Backend  
  ## Description:
  This project was developed to be used as the back-end code of an ecommerce site. The project uses sequelize to set up and interact with the database which stores data on products and their categories and tags. In combination with express routes, the project offers functionality to view, add, update, and delete items in the database. Furthermore, this project utilizes the dotenv package in order to use environmental variables when setting up the database. Attatched below is a link to a video demonstrating the functionality of the api routes tested in Insomnia.
